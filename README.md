Commit Standard:
1. GitHub shall be used as the version control. SubVersion shall be used as the final dropbox.
2. When your changes are done, copy and paste your .java files and your single .xml file into a folder on your desktop.
3. Click on the project folder in this repository that you are working on.
4. Click upload files at the top right of the screen.
5. Copy and paste all of the files that are in the folder on your desktop into the GitHub upload files window.
6. Create a commit message which is meaningful so other members of the group know what you committed. Be sure to write it in third-person present tense.
7. Right under the commit message, click the "create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request" button.
8. Right under the last button, click the green "propose file change" button and wait for GitHub to finish.

Coding Standard:
1. Classes use PascalCase.
2. There belongs one class per file.
3. Files shall be named with the name of the class with .java at the end.
4. Constants are named with SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.
5. Methods are named using camelCase.
6. Variables are named with camelCase.
7. Make the names of classes, methods, and variables useful and descriptive.
8. For curly-brackets, use Java standard: “methodName(int param) {“. Thus, after the ending parenthesis, put a space, then an opening curly-bracket.
9. Make the main class public, and the rest default (no protection modifier).
10. Make methods and instance variables as protected as they can be, ie: private > default > protected > public.
11. Make variables final when they should not change for primitives, and final when the reference should not change for objects.
12. Make a line of code no longer than 120 characters. Android Studio should have a grey bar by default at either 100 or 120 characters.
13. Do not repeat code, make a method for that purpose instead.
14. Methods should do one thing, and do it well. If a method does many things, split it up into multiple methods. As a rule of thumb, if a method is greater than 40 lines, consider shortening it.
